Basic Installation
==================

You need a PERL package compiled with -Dvendorprefix=/some/directory
Its best to not use the perl that came with your Mac or Linux distro.
On mac, you need to install the GMP big number library.

  1. ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-perl=/usr/local \
           --with-gmp=/usr/local

  2. Type `make' to build the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.  You can install into a temp directory using the DESTDIR
     staged install mechanism of autoconf like so.  This is useful for
     putting the output in a package.

         make DESTDIR=/tmp/pkgdir install


Basic Development
=================

Add a perl module to get_cpan_modules.pl.in, or if you just want the 
latest perl modules from cpan you can skip the edit.  Update the configure.ac
version number and update the ChangeLog file making note of what the new
release is for.  Then type

   1.  ./configure_pkg.sh

which will create a new tarball release.  Update and tag the git repository.
